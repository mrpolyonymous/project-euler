# project-euler

Use the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) challenges as a way to learn about [Scala](http://scala-lang.org). And github. And sbt.

## Cheating Project Euler

Project Euler asks that you not publish answers. These are not answers.
They are my explorations of Scala with the project's questions as
motivation. If you can get this code to compile and give the correct
answers faster than implementing the answers yourself I would be
shocked. If this code shows you some minor detail that you've been
missing on your way to getting the correct answer then IMO that's great,
not cheating at all.
